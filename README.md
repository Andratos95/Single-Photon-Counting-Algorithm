# Single-Photon-Counting-Algorithm
The MATLAB code used for the Master Thesis "Multi-spectral X-ray imaging with a laser-plasma accelerator", written by me. 

There are 8 MATLAB code files. The most important one is "xrayMatrix.m" which contains the definition of the class "xrayMatrix" and many of the methods that are used. Please refer to the descriptions of all functions within the files to know exactly how they work.

The file "main_test.m" has an example code that can be run to detect the metals a Ross filter. Make sure to include all the folders with the image files in the directory with the matlab code files.
